"""Per-package coverage-floor gate (roadmap 11 / Q-L7).

The global ``--cov-fail-under`` floor closes the aggregate silent-regression
headroom, but a regression concentrated in one security-critical package can
hide behind a high total. This gate enforces a minimum line-coverage percentage
per package (or single module) against ``coverage.json``.

Floors are intentionally set a few points below current coverage: tight enough
to catch a real regression, loose enough not to trip on incidental churn. Raise
a floor when a package's coverage rises and you want to lock the gain in.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_coverage_floors.py [coverage.json]

Exit status 0 if every floor holds, 1 otherwise (with a per-package report).
