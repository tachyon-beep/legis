"""The coached-cell judge: an interactive wall, not a code generator.

The judge's *logic* — prompt construction, fail-closed verdict parsing, and
model-identity capture — is real and fully tested. Only the model call itself
sits behind the injected ``LLMClient`` seam, so tests need no network and a
production deployment wires a real client. Borrowed *effect* from elspeth's CI
judge, not its vocabulary.

Defense-in-depth around the agent-controlled request (JUDGE-1):

* **Length cap (this module).** Before the model is consulted, the *serialized*
  request — ``{policy, entity, rationale}`` exactly as ``build_prompt`` embeds it
  — is bounded at ``MAX_JUDGE_REQUEST_CHARS``. Over-cap is rejected as BLOCKED by
  a deterministic guard that never calls the model. Measuring the serialized
  request (not the raw rationale) bounds every agent-settable field in one check:
  the rationale, the entity locator (agent-controlled on the degraded-to-locator
  branch), and the unicode-expansion variant (``ensure_ascii`` turns each
  non-ASCII char into a 6-char ``\\uXXXX``, so a raw-char cap would be a 6×-loose
  bound). Reject, never truncate — truncation would mutate the rationale that is
  recorded and (in the protected cell) signed, and could pass a front-loaded
  injection. The over-cap rationale is still written to the trail in full on the
  BLOCKED record, so the attempt stays attributable; bounding what is *persisted*
  is a separate API-boundary concern, not this guard's job.
* **Structural-injection escape (``build_prompt``).** The request is JSON-
  serialized, so a rationale or entity crafted to forge a sibling
  ``{"verdict":"ACCEPTED"}`` key survives only as an escaped string *value*, never
  a structural key. Pinned by the ``build_prompt`` round-trip test (JUDGE-2).

Residual, stated honestly: in the COACHED cell a *semantic* injection — one that
genuinely persuades the model the override is justified — clears the gate, and
that is a model-robustness property, NOT a code fail-open this module can close.
It is mitigated by attribution (the verdict, model id, and rationale are recorded
on the trail) and, in the PROTECTED cell, by Q-H3: the model's ACCEPTED is
advisory and a non-LLM deterministic validator must confirm it (see
``ProtectedGate``). The cap and the escape shrink the *injection surface*; they
do not, and cannot, make the model itself injection-proof.
