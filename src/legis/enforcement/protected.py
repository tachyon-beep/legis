Layered over the coached cell: every verdict is bound to the inspected source

single source of the signed dict — both the gate (write) and ``TrailVerifier``
(read) call it, so they cannot drift. The signed dict binds entity + policy in
addition to the roadmap's six fields, so a valid signed verdict cannot be
