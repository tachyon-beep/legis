"""Protected-cell lifecycle gates — decay sweep + override-rate gate.

Both consume the append-only trail read-only. The decay sweep re-judges only
judge-ACCEPTED suppressions (an OVERRIDDEN_BY_OPERATOR entry would re-block
tautologically — the rate gate governs those instead; a BLOCKED entry is not a
suppression at all).
