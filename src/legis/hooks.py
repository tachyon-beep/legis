"""SessionStart / MCP-boot refresh for legis instruction artifacts.

Two callers drive ``refresh_instructions``:

- the ``legis session-context`` CLI subcommand, registered as a Claude Code
  SessionStart hook, and
- ``legis mcp`` startup (best-effort), which is the universal trigger that also
  covers Codex-only repos with no ``.claude/`` hook.

Both refresh *in place* only — they never create a block or skill pack that is
not already present (that is ``legis install``'s job). A non-project cwd
produces no refresh work, because the refresh only ever touches marker-bearing
files — but the CLI subcommand still emits a one-line posture banner, so an
agent can distinguish "nothing to report" from "broken" (dogfood N-1).
