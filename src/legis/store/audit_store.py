"""Append-only audit store.

Record-agnostic: persists opaque dict payloads as canonical JSON in an ordered,
hash-chained, append-only table. It knows nothing about override records or any
other schema layered on top (those serialize to dict and hand bytes here).

Two integrity layers, complementary:
  * **Triggers** reject UPDATE/DELETE at the DB level — mutation is *rejected,
    not discouraged*, and there is no mutation method on this class.
  * **Hash chain** lets ``verify_integrity`` detect any out-of-band edit or
    reordering that bypasses the triggers (e.g. direct file tampering). This is
    the seed of the protected cell's tamper-evidence story (Sprint 3).

    """Apply the durability/concurrency PRAGMAs to a freshly-opened connection.

    Best-effort: a PRAGMA failure must not break connection setup (the store is
    still usable without WAL), but it must NOT vanish silently either. Two
    distinct failure channels are surfaced:

    * An exception while issuing a PRAGMA → logged with ``exc_info``.
    * WAL silently not taking effect → ``PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`` does *not*
      raise when WAL is unavailable (read-only mount, some network filesystems,
      in-memory DBs); it returns the journal mode actually in force. The old
      ``except Exception: pass`` never caught this most-likely case, so the
      connection ran without WAL and the symptom surfaced much later as an
      opaque "database is locked" under concurrency. Detect and log it here.

    Durability is ``synchronous=FULL``, NOT the throughput-favouring ``NORMAL``
    (AUD-3). Under WAL, ``NORMAL`` fsyncs the WAL only at a checkpoint, so a
    committed-but-not-yet-checkpointed append is lost on a power-cut — and the
    survivors form a consistent, contiguous, fully-signed chain, i.e. a
    valid-looking *shortened* trail indistinguishable from "nothing more was
    written". For an audit-integrity store that silent tail-loss is the harm,
    so each commit is fsynced (``FULL``); throughput is the right thing to
    trade. This is the prevention half; AUD-1's out-of-band head anchor is the
    detection half (it flags a trail that shrank below its recorded head). The
    floor is intentionally not configurable — an audit store's durability must
    not be lowerable back to the bug.
