"""Bind a cleared governed sign-off to a Filigree issue, keyed on SEI.

legis governs; Filigree owns issue state. This attaches the attestation as an
entity-association (``entity_id`` = the SEI, opaque to Filigree) so the code↔
governance binding survives rename/move. It does NOT mutate Filigree issue
status — lifecycle transitions remain Filigree's authority (locked decision 5).
A locator-keyed sign-off is rejected: an unstable binding would orphan on rename,
defeating the point.

Binding availability is therefore coupled to identity stability (an SEI, which
Loomweave produces). The contract for a degraded Loomweave is ADR-0003: the
``bind-issue`` handler first tries to resolve a locator through a ``SEI_BACKFILL``
event (recovery), and otherwise **fails closed** (HTTP 409) rather than recording
a rename-fragile placeholder. The sign-off itself is always recorded; only the
Filigree pointer waits for a stable identity. See
``docs/design/adr/0003-filigree-binding-availability.md``.

When a ``ledger`` is supplied, the order is validate → attach → record: after a
successful attach, a tamper-bound ``BindingRecord`` is appended to the ledger and
its sequence number is returned to the caller as ``binding_seq``. The Filigree row
stays an opaque pointer; the ledger is where the binding's integrity lives.
