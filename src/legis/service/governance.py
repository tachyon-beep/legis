    ``trail_owner`` is whichever gate owns the trail being read: the protected
    gate for the governance trail, or the sign-off gate for the sign-off trail
    (the API ``bind-issue`` path passes the latter). When no owner is wired the
    simple-tier engine owns it instead (read lazily via ``engine_records`` so a
    protected deployment never initialises the engine store). Never mix the two
    stores. Verification is fail-closed and applies to EVERY consumer of the
    trail, so a tampered record is an honest integrity error
    (``AuditIntegrityError``), never silently read or scored.

    ``trail_owner`` and ``trail_verifier`` are intentionally left duck-typed (an
    owner exposing ``records()`` / ``verify_integrity()`` and a verifier
    exposing ``verify()``) so the service layer is not coupled to the
    enforcement concrete types.

    Cost note (rc4 review #7): this verifies the *whole* trail on every call —
    ``verify_integrity()`` re-hashes the chain (O(N)) and ``trail_verifier.verify``
    re-checks signatures (O(N)) — including on interactive paths (the keyed
    override-submit idempotency check and every override-rate read). That cost is
    the tamper-evidence property, not an oversight: there is no load-time or
    open-time verification anywhere (``AuditStore.__init__`` only creates the
    schema), so this path is the only thing standing between a tampered record and
    an interactive read. Two tempting optimizations are deliberately NOT taken:
    reserving full verification for the explicit governance-gate would leave every
    interactive read unverified (a silent tamper window); and incremental
    verification (trusting a cached last-verified prefix and re-hashing only the
    new tail) cannot detect out-of-band tampering of an already-verified record —
    exactly what the hash chain exists to catch — and still would not reach O(1),
    because the signature pass is O(N) regardless. If trail size ever makes this
    latency-bound, the honest lever is trail retention/compaction, not narrowing
    what each read verifies.
