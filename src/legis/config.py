"""Store-location resolver — the single source for legis's database URLs.

These previously lived on ``legis.api.app``, which forced ``mcp`` (and any
other composition root) to import from the HTTP layer just to learn where the
governance store lives (Q-H2). They are transport-agnostic configuration, so
they belong here; ``api`` and ``mcp`` both import them from this module.

**Federated store layout.** legis's machine-written runtime state lives under
``.weft/legis/`` at the project root — the federation convention shared with
the other weft members. legis is the *sole writer* of this subtree. Resolution
is anchored at the current working directory: the same notion the installer
uses (``cli.py`` sets ``project_root = Path.cwd()``), and every member resolves
``.weft/`` against that same cwd, so running each tool from the project root
keeps them in agreement. The default URLs are therefore cwd-relative
(``sqlite:///.weft/legis/...``), preserving the historical resolution semantics.

**weft.toml is enrich-only, never load-bearing.** The operator-authored
``weft.toml`` may carry a ``[legis]`` table; we read it but never write it.
The single enrichment knob is ``store_dir`` (relocate the subtree; relative to
the project root, or absolute). Per-DB overrides remain the ``LEGIS_*_DB`` env
vars, which take precedence over weft.toml — a precedence the ``*_db_url()``
resolvers below implement directly (via ``_resolve_db_url``), so every consumer
gets it by calling the resolver, not by re-wrapping it. An absent file, an
absent ``[legis]`` section, or even a malformed weft.toml must still boot on the
built-in defaults — legis never *depends* on weft.toml (Doctrine §5 deletion
test).

**Clean break.** There is no fallback to the old cwd-root locations
(``legis-governance.db`` &c.). Existing deployments move their files into
``.weft/legis/`` or pin the ``LEGIS_*_DB`` env vars.

**Keys are out of scope.** Operator-held signing keys are the authority-key
carve-out — capability-confined and deliberately not agent-reachable. They are
env-provided secrets, not files under this subtree; nothing here touches key
storage.
