"""The policy grammar — one shared contract, an open agent-authored instance set.

The grammar defines what a policy boundary *is* (a ``BoundaryType`` that, given a
target, returns CLEAR / VIOLATION / UNKNOWN) and what fail-closed means. Boundary
types are registered: builtins as defaults, agents adding their own with zero
human config. Soundness is inherited, not waived — anything the engine cannot
prove (an unregistered policy, a boundary that returns UNKNOWN, or one that
raises / returns garbage) yields UNKNOWN with a provenance gap, never a
false-green. Same seam shape as Wardline's ``TaintSourceProvider`` and Loomweave's
``Transport``.
