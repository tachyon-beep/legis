"""Single source of policy-boundary test-evidence judgement.

The static scanner (``boundary_scan``) and the runtime gate
(``decorator.check_policy_boundary``) both call this, so the two gates cannot
drift apart. Strictest-of-both semantics: the exercise check excludes calls that
appear only inside uninvoked nested helper definitions; policy evidence must
co-occur with boundary evidence inside a single ``assert``.

    Deliberately broad and fail-closed: it matches the terminal attribute or bare
    name (``pytest.mark.skip``, ``mark.xfail``, ``m.skipif(...)``, or a bare
    ``skip`` imported under that name), with or without a call. The fingerprint is
    blind to decorators AND the marker's import alias lives outside the function
    source it sees, so a chain match anchored on a literal ``pytest`` would leave
    the alias path open. The population of evidence tests is tiny and the only
    decorators legitimately placed on them are pytest markers, so over-matching
    merely (loudly) blocks a boundary a human then resolves, whereas
    under-matching would silently let a disabled test satisfy the gate — the exact
    false-green this closes.

    Residuals it does NOT catch, by design: a module-level
    ``pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip`` or a class-level ``@pytest.mark.skip`` on the
    test's enclosing class. Both are the same false-green class, but the runtime
    gate only has ``inspect.getsource`` of the test function/method — it
    structurally cannot see module globals or the class decorator — so flagging
    them here would break the Q-L5 runtime/static parity contract.
