# Reading Legis output — what am I seeing when an agent does X (operator guide)

You are **on the loop, not in it.** Most of what legis emits is for *asynchronous
review*: an attributable record of what an agent did, so you can audit it later —
not a prompt demanding you act right now. A few signals *do* require a human, and
they say so explicitly. This guide tells you, for each signal: **where it
surfaces, what it means, and whether you need to act.**

For *why* the cells behave this way see [`README.md`](../../README.md); for the
agent-side call mechanics see the `legis-workflow` skill. This guide is the human
reading layer.

## Two vocabularies, deliberately distinct

These look similar and are easy to conflate. They are different layers:

- **The call outcome envelope** — what an agent's `override_submit` *call returns*
  in the moment. Values: `ACCEPTED_SELF`, `ACCEPTED_BY_JUDGE`, `BLOCKED`,
  `ESCALATED_PENDING`, `NEED_INPUTS`. This is transient: it tells the agent what
  to do next.
- **The recorded Verdict** — what is *written to the audit trail*. Values:
  `ACCEPTED`, `BLOCKED`, `OVERRIDDEN_BY_OPERATOR`. This is durable: it is what you
  read when you review.

They overlap on `BLOCKED` but mean different things in different places. When in
doubt: an **envelope** is what a tool call returned; a **Verdict** is what the
trail says happened.

## When an agent overrides a policy

This is the core event. An agent hit a policy at the CI/git boundary and chose to
override rather than refactor. What you see depends on the cell governing that
policy.

| Outcome envelope | Cell | What it means | Do you act? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ACCEPTED_SELF` | chill | The agent self-cleared with a recordable override. | **No** — review the trail when convenient. The record is attributable; nothing was silently passed. |
| `ACCEPTED_BY_JUDGE` | coached / protected | The LLM judge accepted the override before it recorded. (In protected, may be re-judged later by the decay sweep.) | **No** in coached. In protected, watch the override-rate gate over time. |
| `BLOCKED` | coached / protected | The judge refused. The agent **cannot self-clear past it** — it must revise the code or its rationale and resubmit. The blocked attempt does **not** count toward the override-rate. | **No** — this is the wall working. The agent is expected to fix and retry. |
| `ESCALATED_PENDING` | structured | A hard gate. A human operator must sign off before it clears. The agent is told to wait. | **Yes** — *you* are the gate. Review and sign off (or refuse). |
| `NEED_INPUTS` | protected | The submission is missing required evidence (e.g. `file_fingerprint`, `ast_path`). The agent must supply them and resubmit. | **No** — the agent self-corrects. |

A `BLOCKED` envelope also carries a `blocked_reason_code` so you (or the agent) can
see *why*:

| `blocked_reason_code` | Roughly means |
|---|---|
| `RATIONALE_INSUFFICIENT` | The justification was too thin — sharpen it. |
| `CODE_VIOLATION` | The change itself trips the policy — fix the code, not the words. |
| `POLICY_HARD_BLOCK` | A policy that is not meant to be talked past at all. |
| `UNCLASSIFIED` | The judge refused without a recognised category. |

**The only outcome that needs you in real time is `ESCALATED_PENDING`** — a
structured sign-off. Everything else is async-review or agent-self-correct.

## What the audit trail records

When you review (rather than watch live), you read recorded **Verdicts** keyed on
SEI (so they survive renames/moves):

| Recorded Verdict | What happened |
|---|---|
| `ACCEPTED` | The override was accepted — by the agent itself (chill) or by the judge (coached/protected). |
| `BLOCKED` | The judge refused; this attempt was not a kept suppression. |
| `OVERRIDDEN_BY_OPERATOR` | A human operator forced the decision past the gate. **This is the line item to watch** — see the override-rate gate below. |

A structured request you have not yet actioned shows sign-off state
`PENDING_SIGNOFF`; once you sign, `SIGNED_OFF`.

In the protected cell, each recorded verdict is HMAC-signed and bound to the exact
source bytes and AST node the judge inspected (`file_fingerprint` + `ast_path`), so
an after-the-fact edit by someone who cannot recompute the signature is detectable.

## When an agent routes a Wardline scan

`scan_route` feeds Wardline findings into governance. You will see an **outcome**
and, on the artifact, a **status**:

| `scan_route` outcome | Meaning | Do you act? |
|---|---|---|
| `ROUTED` | Findings were governed into the configured cell. Normal path. | No. |
| `SKIPPED_DIRTY_TREE` | A *typed amber skip*, not an error: an unsigned dirty-tree dev artifact arrived where signed provenance is required. **Nothing was governed.** | No — the agent commits for a signed artifact (or a dev sets `LEGIS_WARDLINE_ALLOW_DIRTY=1`). Distinguishable from a real failure on purpose. |

The artifact's provenance `status` tells you how far it verified:

| `artifact_status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `verified` | Signed, clean-tree artifact — full provenance. |
| `dirty` | Governed an unsigned dirty-tree artifact (only under the dev opt-in). Honest about what it is. |
| `unverified` | Provenance could not be confirmed. |

## Identity and lineage status

Because legis keys on SEI from Loomweave, you will see how identity resolution
went. An `unavailable` is **honest degradation, not an error** — it means legis
could not reach a Loomweave decision and refused to guess.

| `identity_resolution_status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `resolved` | SEI resolved; the record keys on stable identity. |
| `not_alive` | The entity is no longer live per Loomweave. |
| `unavailable` | No Loomweave capability/decision (e.g. `LOOMWEAVE_API_URL` unwired). Degraded honestly. |
| `invalid` | (Backfill path only) the legacy record could not be keyed. |

| `lineage_snapshot_status` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `verified` | Lineage snapshot confirmed. |
| `unavailable` | Could not confirm (sibling unwired or no decision). |
| `not_applicable` | No lineage applies to this record. |

> If a governance posture endpoint reports `diverged` (lineage integrity) or a
> status of `unavailable` where you expected `checked`, that is the honesty
> machinery doing its job — it refuses to report a false "all clear." Investigate
> the sibling wiring; do not read the bare absence of a finding as success.

## The override-rate gate

This is the **single most important signal to watch over time.** It measures the
share of kept suppressions that were *forced past the judge by an operator*
(`OVERRIDDEN_BY_OPERATOR ÷ (ACCEPTED + OVERRIDDEN_BY_OPERATOR)`) over a rolling
window. Agent retries and blocked attempts do **not** move it — only operator
force-pasts do.

| Gate status | Meaning | Do you act? |
|---|---|---|
| `PASS` | Operator override rate is under threshold. | No. |
| `FAIL` | Too many operator force-pasts. **Either the policy is miscalibrated, or an operator is breaking their own rules to ship.** Either way it is now observable, not silent. | **Yes** — investigate which, and recalibrate or stop. |
| `PASS_WITH_NOTICE` | Sample below the minimum — too few records to judge mechanically. | No (yet). |

Where you see it:
- In-session: `override_rate_get` → `{status, rate, sample_size}`.
- In CI: `legis check-override-rate` (or `legis governance-gate`) prints
  `override-rate gate: <STATUS> (rate=…, sample=…)` and **exits 1 on `FAIL`**.

## CI gate exit codes

| Command | Exit 0 | Exit 1 |
|---|---|---|
| `legis check-override-rate` / `legis governance-gate` | `PASS` / `PASS_WITH_NOTICE` | `FAIL`, or a failed hash-chain integrity check, or a missing DB under `CI=true` (without the dev allow-flag). |
| `legis policy-boundary-check` | `policy-boundary-check: PASS` | One `path:line: rule_id: qualname: reason` per finding — a `@policy_boundary` lacks current behavioural evidence. |

## `legis doctor` tags

Each problem line is tagged so you know who fixes it:

- `[auto-fixable]` — `legis doctor --fix` can repair it (install-layer wiring).
- `[operator]` — **not** auto-fixable; needs out-of-band config (an env var or
  file) and a relaunch. The line names the action.
- `[fixed]` — a `--fix` run just repaired it.

doctor reports the governance surface; it never auto-enables a cell or touches a
signing key.

## MCP tool errors (one to never ignore)

The agent surface returns typed `error_code`s with `recoverable` and `next_action`
hints (the full table is in the `legis-workflow` skill). Almost all are
agent-recoverable by fixing input or asking you to enable a cell. **One is not:**

> **`AUDIT_INTEGRITY_FAILURE`** — a hash-chain or binding-ledger verification
> failed. This is not recoverable and must not be retried. It means the audit
> trail's tamper-evidence tripped. **Stop and inspect the governance store.**

`INTERNAL_ERROR` is likewise not auto-recoverable — surface it to a human.

---

**In one sentence:** if you see `ESCALATED_PENDING` (sign-off), an override-rate
`FAIL`, or `AUDIT_INTEGRITY_FAILURE`, a human is needed; almost everything else is
the system working as designed and waiting for your *asynchronous* review.
